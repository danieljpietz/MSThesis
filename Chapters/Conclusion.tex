\chapter{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK} \label{chap:conclusions}
This thesis presented a novel algorithm for numerically computing the constraints of optimization-based controllers. Examples were demonstrated where this algorithm improves run-time performance by 3x and reduces program size by 575x. While superior performance is shown for high-degree-of-freedom complex systems, this is not the case for systems with low degrees of freedom and little non-linear behavior. In future works, the author intends to further improve performance by exploiting opportunities for parallelism within the algorithm. Given that the algorithm only works for rigid open-kinematic chains, an implementation for soft body systems, as well as closed kinematic chains is an open problem. Further development of the existing \algname{} definition for more CBF classes is an open problem as well, such as stochastic CBFs, and CBFs of order three or more.
