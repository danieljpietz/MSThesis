In recent years, the development of Control Barrier Functions (CBF) has allowed safety guarantees to be placed on nonlinear control affine systems. While powerful as a mathematical tool, CBF implementations on systems with high relative degree constraints can become too computationally intensive for real-time control. Such deployments typically rely on the analysis of a system's symbolic equations of motion, leading to large, platform-specific control programs that do not generalize well. To address this, a more generalized framework is needed. \newline

This thesis provides a formulation for second-order CBFs for rigid open kinematic chains. An algorithm for numerically computing the safe control input of a CBF is then introduced based on this formulation. It is shown that this algorithm can be used on a broad category of systems, with specific examples shown for convoy platooning, drone obstacle avoidance, and robotic arms with large degrees of freedom. These examples show up to three-times performance improvements in computation time as well as several orders of magnitude in the reduction in program size.
